A Useful, Interactive, and Extensible .NET Console Application Template for Development and Testing
===================================================================================================
The goal here was not to emulate a fully-functioning Shell or terminal. I wanted to be able to:

* Run the program, be greeted with a prompt (customizable, in this case), and then enter commands corresponding to various methods defined in a specific area of the application. 
* Receive feedback (where appropriate), error messages, and such 
* Easily add/remove commands 
* Generally be able to quickly put together a functioning console application, with predictable and familiar interactive behavior, without re-inventing the wheel every time.
